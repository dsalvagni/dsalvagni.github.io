This is me trying to blog again. I'm moving from Jekyll back to Wordpress and you can find me here [dsalvagni.com.br](https://www.dsalvagni.com.br).
I'll keep this address on github.io as well, just because I don't want to migrate all older posts to Wordpress - and there are a couple about Magento that were written in Portuguese that I want to keep here though.

By the way, I'll try to keep the blog a bit more personal. If I found something interesting to write about web dev, I will write about it definitely. However, I hope I can use this space to write about something not related to work.
