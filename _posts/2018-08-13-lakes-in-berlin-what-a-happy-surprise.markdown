I must say that find such a warm summer in Europe was a surprise for me. To be completely fair, these last two summers [hadn't not the normal average temperatures](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-01/balmy-june-to-boost-energy-use-with-europeans-turning-on-air-con) so and it's fair to say that even for people that are living here longer than me this isn't weather wasn't expected. This is not small talk and I'm not here to warning about global warming, it's just a note to put you and context about why I'm so happy that around Berlin has an [incredible number of swimming lakes](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/lakes).

[Visitberlin.de](https://www.visitberlin.de) website has good recommendation regarding _how to visit_ and _where to go_. Worth to check it out. Currently I've being in four of them and I'd the chance to swim in three. I went also to the M√ºgelsee, but hadn't the chance to really enjoy it as I was on a bike ride - took some pictures though.

The [Teufelssee at Grunewald](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d6869347-Reviews-Teufelssee-Berlin.html) was the first lake I went here and I got there totally randomly. Lu√≠sa and I went to visit Grunewald and Teufelsberg that day and we were wondering around until we found a lake in the map. It's a small lake on a green area there, quite nice. There was also when I found it's a _Freik√∂rperkultur (FKK)_ place. It wasn't quite a surprise since I already knew there were some spots here where the Free Body Culture is allowed. The real surprise was seeing people swimming there since we were on Spring and the water was quite cold. üòÖ

As the weather started to get warmer, Lu√≠sa and I decided to look for some places to cold our heads besides drinking cold beer. I knew some of our friends here had being in some lakes so I asked for recommendations. I've received a list of the following lakes: Schlachtensee; Wei√üensee and Wandlitzsee; We went to the first two, and later we found the Liepnitzee. 

At the [Schlachtensee](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/schlachtensee) I've got the chance to jump in the water for the first time this summer. I'd missed one opportunity when I was in Z√ºrich, shame on me. I love this lake and it so easy to get there that is my favorite since the first time. It's not that close though, takes ~1h "door-to-door" but totally worth going there. It has a S-Bahn station by the lake so you jump from the train to lake on one step. üòÑ You can go there early in the morning and spend the day there. I think it's allowed to even do a barbecue there. Isn't it great? The water is not that cold and it's pretty clean. Not crystal clear such as in Liepnitzee, but you won't be disappointed. There's a small biergarten in the S-Bahn station and I believe also a restaurant in the park. Both times I've being there I took something to drink and eat from home, so don't really know how these places are.

I believe in the same week we went to [the Wei√üensee](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/strandbad-weissensee). It's a small lake in a park on a really convenient location. You can get there by tram, it's in the Lichtenberg quarter. That day we decide to go almost in the end of day, after working hours, and the place was way busy since Berlin was burning in the sun. It was almost impossible to find a spot close to the water but we did. As I said, it's pretty convenient to get there, so you are going to find it busy quite often. I'd totally go there again.

The last one we went was the Liepnitzsee. This one was the most incredible lake I've being so far. The water is crystal clear and you can see your whole body under the water. Besides that, it's surrounded by a green forest where you can also go for a walking/trekking. It's not so convenient to go there though. I guess it's not in Berlin anymore, but on a city close. To get there you'll need to get a regional train and then ride ~10km by bike. That was the path we did. We've head that you can also get out of the train on a different station and the distance to the lake would be closer from there. Although 10km seems a bit of a ride, I'd recommend taking this path. It's amazing as almost the whole path has cicloway and the most part you ride through the woods. It's also a good place for camping, but unfortunately you cannot make use of fire there. So, no barbecue.

The hardest part isn't the way to get there, but to choose where to sit as it has such great spots and views. Fortunately, we found a nice spot with the view I'll attach below.

I'm glad that we found these places to enjoy the summer here. It's great to live in a big city that also offers you an easy way out of the concrete & confusion, so you can recover and have the time to just enjoy the nature. üçÉ
