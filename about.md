title: About me 
---

I’m a full-stack web developer. Started developing pages in 2001 and I’ve been working with web development since 2003. I’m fluent in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. I also have a large knowledge about ASP.NET MVC with C#, Entity Framework and LINQ.

My main skills are write scalabe, modular and readable code and be capable to work in frontend and backend. I also do it fast.

I learned all by myself, as self-taught. However, nowadays I’m in the college to get my graduation in Analysis and systems development.
